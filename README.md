This project is based on process and extracting data from images taken from a CCD camera.

Project Title: Image Processing of Globular Cluster (Astrophysics coding project,
Apr-Jun 2022)

Overview: The objective of this project is to process images and extract data
obtained from images that were taken from a CCD camera at Hutton-Westfold
observatory. These raw images had to be preprocessed in order to obtain
meaningful data such as the brightness of the stars and the distance to the
captured objects.

My Role:
- Subtracting the Bias and Dark frames in the images using the ccdproc
library in Python. (Jupyter Notebook)
Using Python, I had to ensured that all of the pictures were aligned with
matching frames.
- Data comparisons between that of the images and that with literature
values.
- Using sufficiently complex mathematical equations to obtain information
about the stars in the image.

Outcomes:
- Obtained clear and suitable images of a Globular cluster by filtering the
images in Python.
- Using the astropy library to compare obtained data with literature data.
- Applying equations in Python to obtain the distance and composition of the
cluster.
